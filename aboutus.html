More specifically, she wants to investigate themes that are typical among underserved populations and how one's culture plays a role in stress management.
                            She plans on continuing on to graduate school to pursue a degree in clinical psychology.
                            In her free time, Melissa enjoys exploring new places and spending time with her friends and family.
